# Duckietown Simulator

[2017-10-11 Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2-KIFl0sBp39PCQfJB-0MNN-UxoQTrf57uf72-D8Hk/edit)

Goals:
- Provide a docker container with a simulation that people can deploy
  - People should be able to connect to one or more simulation machine (ie: clusters)
- Easy to use Python library for interacting with the simulation
  - Ideally compatible with OpenAI gym
- First version will use a fixed Duckietown map layout, no buildings
